# NekoToki Stopwatch ‚è∞‚ú®

A simple, customizable, floating stopwatch application with a touch of cuteness (and stars!).

## Features

*   **Standard Stopwatch:** Start, pause, and reset functionality.
*   **Always on Top:** Stays visible above other windows.
*   **Frameless & Draggable:** Clean look, click and drag anywhere on the window (except controls) to move.
*   **Resizable:** Resize from the edges and corners.
*   **Custom Background:**
    *   Click the '+' button to show background controls.
    *   Double-click the 'üñº' button to select a custom background image (*.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.bmp).
    *   Adjust the transparency of the custom image or the default background using the slider.
    *   Click "Change" to select a different image.
    *   Click "Reset" to go back to the default background.
    *   Aspect ratio lock is automatically enabled when an image is loaded (disable by hiding controls or resetting).
*   **Star Effect:** Subtle white stars float on the background.
*   **Minimal Interface:** Clean UI that gets out of your way.
